## Quick Fix (5 Minutes Total)

### Option 1: Manual Steps (Recommended - Most Reliable)

#### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dieqhiezcpexkivklxcw/storage/buckets
2. Click **"Create bucket"**
3. Enter details:
   - **Name**: `gallery-images`
   - **Public**: Toggle **ON** ✓
   - **File size limit**: `10485760` (10MB)
4. Click **"Create bucket"**

#### Step 2: Apply Storage RLS Policies (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dieqhiezcpexkivklxcw/sql
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Copy and paste the **PART 2: STORAGE RLS POLICIES** section from `COMPLETE_GALLERY_FIX_ALL_IN_ONE.sql`
4. Click **"Run"** (or Ctrl+Enter)
5. Verify you see "Success" message

#### Step 3: Test Upload (1 minute)
1. Go to: https://1klct3zdsvna.space.minimax.io
2. Log in to admin panel
3. Create or edit a blog post
4. Try uploading an image to the gallery
5. Upload should succeed!

### Option 2: All-in-One SQL Script

If you prefer running everything at once:

1. **First create the bucket manually** (Step 1 above - cannot be done via SQL)
2. **Then run** `COMPLETE_GALLERY_FIX_ALL_IN_ONE.sql` in SQL Editor
   - This applies both database schema and storage policies
   - Safe to re-run multiple times

---

## What Each File Does

### Database Schema Files
- `URGENT_DATABASE_FIX.sql` - Database schema only (already applied ✓)
- Creates gallery columns and post_images table

### Storage Policy Files  
- `STORAGE_RLS_FIX.sql` - Storage policies only (needs bucket first)
- Configures who can upload/view/delete images

### Combined Files
- `COMPLETE_GALLERY_FIX_ALL_IN_ONE.sql` - Everything in one script
- Most convenient after bucket is created

### Testing Files
- `verify-gallery-system.mjs` - Automated verification script
- Tests all components end-to-end

## Why Storage Bucket Must Be Created Manually

Supabase Storage buckets cannot be created via SQL - they require the Storage API or dashboard interface. This is a Supabase platform limitation, not a script issue.

**Workflow:**
1. Create bucket via Dashboard/API ← **Manual step required**
2. Configure RLS policies via SQL ← **Can be automated**

---

## After Setup - Verification

To verify everything is working:

**Option A: Manual Test**
1. Go to admin panel
2. Upload an image
3. Check it displays correctly

**Option B: Automated Test** (I can run this)
```bash
cd /workspace/free-marketplace
node scripts/verify-gallery-system.mjs
```

This will test:
- Database schema ✓
- Storage bucket existence
- RLS policies
- End-to-end upload flow

## Current Blocking Issue

**You are blocked at**: Creating the `gallery-images` storage bucket

**Quickest unblock**: Go to Storage dashboard and create the bucket (2 minutes)

After bucket creation, everything else can be automated or verified by me.

## Need Help?

If you encounter any errors after creating the bucket:
1. Share the error message
2. Tell me which step failed
3. I can provide targeted fixes

The system is 90% complete - just needs the storage bucket created!

---

**Recommended next action**: Create the bucket now (2 minutes), then let me know so I can verify everything is working.
