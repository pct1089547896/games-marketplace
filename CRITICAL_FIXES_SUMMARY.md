## üéØ **ISSUE 1: Admin Content Upload (CRITICAL)**

### **Problem Solved**
The admin content upload was failing silently because Row Level Security (RLS) policies only allowed `anon` and `service_role` users, but logged-in admins become `authenticated` users.

### **‚úÖ Solution Implemented**
1. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging to admin dashboard
2. **RLS Migration Created**: Fixed policies to allow authenticated users

### **üîß ACTION REQUIRED: Apply Database Migration**

**STEP 1**: Go to your Supabase Dashboard
- Navigate to: https://app.supabase.com/project/dieqhiezcpexkivklxcw
- Click **SQL Editor**

**STEP 2**: Copy and execute this SQL migration:
```sql
-- Run the entire content from: /workspace/supabase/migrations/1761738200_fix_admin_rls_policies.sql
```

**STEP 3**: Test admin content upload
- Login to admin panel: https://sccogd7a1mmq.space.minimax.io/admin/login
- Try creating a game, program, or blog post
- Check browser console for success messages

## üéØ **ISSUE 2: Forum Moderation System ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

### **‚úÖ Implementation Complete**
- **New Posts**: Now flagged as `'pending'` instead of immediately published
- **Admin Control**: Added "Pending" status filter in forum moderation
- **Approval Workflow**: Admins can change status from "pending" to "published"
- **Translation**: Full English ("Pending") / Spanish ("Pendiente") support

### **How It Works**
1. User creates forum post ‚Üí Status = "pending"
2. Post not visible to public users
3. Admin goes to Forum Moderation tab
4. Admin filters by "Pending" status
5. Admin changes status to "Published" to approve post
