## Action Required

### IMPORTANT: Apply Database Migration

The database migration must be run to create tables and load all themes:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Navigate to SQL Editor section

3. **Run the Migration**
   - Copy the COMPLETE SQL from:
     `supabase/migrations/create_theme_management_tables.sql`
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

4. **Verify Success**
   - Run this verification query:
   ```sql
   SELECT category, COUNT(*) as theme_count
   FROM themes
   GROUP BY category
   ORDER BY category;
   ```
   - You should see 31 themes across 7 categories

5. **Check Default Theme**
   ```sql
   SELECT t.display_name, t.category
   FROM active_theme at
   JOIN themes t ON at.theme_id = t.id;
   ```
   - Should show "Minimalist Clean" as active
