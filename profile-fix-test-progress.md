**Deployed URL**: https://2w53uogwhovv.space.minimax.io
**Test Date**: 2025-10-29

## Testing Progress

### Step 1: Pre-Test Planning
- Website complexity: Complex (MPA with authentication)
- Test strategy: Focus on profile system authentication and data fetching

### Step 2: Comprehensive Testing
**Status**: Starting

### Issues to Verify Fixed:
1. "User not found" error - should be resolved by database trigger
2. "Access denied" error - should be resolved by proper profile creation
3. /profile route - should redirect to current user's profile
4. Profile editing - should work for authenticated users

## Fixes Applied:
1. ✓ Created database trigger to auto-create user profiles on signup
2. ✓ Created missing profile for existing user
3. ✓ Added /profile route that redirects to current user's profile
4. ✓ Profile editing permissions verified via RLS policies
