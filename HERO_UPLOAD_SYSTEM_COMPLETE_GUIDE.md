## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Automatic Setup Process**
When you upload media, the system automatically:

1. **Checks for bucket existence**
2. **Calls setup function to configure RLS policies**
3. **Attempts upload with enhanced error handling**
4. **Provides clear error messages if issues persist**

### **Error Handling**
- RLS policy violations → Automatic retry after setup
- Missing bucket → Automatic bucket creation
- Permission issues → Clear troubleshooting instructions
- File size issues → Size validation before upload

## 📝 If Upload Still Fails

If you still get "new row violates row-level security policy" after the automatic setup:

### **Manual Solution Steps:**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Storage section

2. **Check Storage Policies**
   - Go to Authentication → Policies
   - Look for policies related to `storage.objects`

3. **Try Alternative Upload**
   - Log out and log back in as admin
   - Try the upload again
   - The automatic setup should handle permissions

4. **Check User Role**
   - Ensure your user has admin privileges
   - Verify you're logged in with the correct account

## 📁 Database Tables
- `hero_settings` - Stores hero configuration
- `hero_media` - Media file metadata and URLs

## 🔐 Security
- All hero media is publicly accessible (required for web display)
- Only authenticated admins can upload/delete media
- File type and size validation on frontend and backend
- Automatic cleanup and error handling
