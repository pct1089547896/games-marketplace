# Bio Section Removal - Complete

## Summary

The Bio section has been successfully removed from the profile system to create a cleaner, more focused user interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. ProfileEditPage.tsx
**Removed Bio Input Field**:
- Removed `bio` from formData state
- Removed Bio textarea input (including character counter)
- Removed Bio from database update query
- Simplified profile editing form to just Display Name and Avatar

**Before**:
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  display_name: '',
  bio: '',
  avatar_url: ''
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  display_name: '',
  avatar_url: ''
});
```

### 2. Translation Files
**Removed Bio Keys**:
- en.json: Removed "bio" and "bioPlaceholder"
- es.json: Removed "bio" and "bioPlaceholder"

All other translation keys preserved.

### 3. UserProfilePage.tsx
**No Changes Needed**:
- Bio was never displayed in the profile view
- All functionality remains intact

### 4. Database
**Bio Column Preserved**:
- Bio column remains in user_profiles table (not removed)
- This prevents any data loss
- Simply not used in the UI anymore
