# Profile System Fix - Complete

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: "User not found" Error
**Root Cause**: User accounts existed in auth.users table but had no corresponding profiles in user_profiles table.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Created database function `handle_new_user()` that automatically creates a user profile when a new user signs up
2. Created database trigger `on_auth_user_created` that calls this function on INSERT to auth.users
3. Retroactively created profile for existing user

**Technical Details**:
```sql
-- Function creates profile with:
- id: from auth.users.id
- email: from auth.users.email
- display_name: from metadata or email prefix
- avatar_url: from metadata if available
- post_count: initialized to 0
- created_at, last_active: current timestamp
```

### Issue 2: "Access denied" Error
**Root Cause**: Users couldn't access their profile edit page because they had no profile record to edit.

**Solution Applied**:
- Same as Issue 1 - profiles are now automatically created
- Verified RLS policies are correct:
  - Everyone can view profiles (SELECT)
  - Users can only update their own profile (UPDATE where auth.uid() = id)

### Issue 3: Profile Route Handling
**Problem**: No /profile route existed, navbar linked directly to /profile/:userId

**Solution Applied**:
1. Created new component: `ProfileRedirect.tsx`
   - Checks if user is authenticated
   - Redirects to /profile/:userId if logged in
   - Redirects to login page if not authenticated
2. Added /profile route to App.tsx routing configuration

### Files Modified

1. **Database Migration**:
   - `/workspace/supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_create_user_profile_trigger.sql`
   - Function: `handle_new_user()`
   - Trigger: `on_auth_user_created`

2. **Frontend Files**:
   - `/workspace/free-marketplace/src/pages/ProfileRedirect.tsx` (NEW)
   - `/workspace/free-marketplace/src/App.tsx` (modified - added /profile route)

3. **No changes needed to**:
   - UserProfilePage.tsx (already had proper error handling)
   - ProfileEditPage.tsx (already had proper auth checks)
   - Navigation.tsx (already had correct profile links)
   - AuthContext.tsx (already working correctly)

### Testing Recommendations

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **New User Signup** (Verify automatic profile creation):
   - Create a new account via Google OAuth or email/password
   - Check that profile is automatically created in user_profiles table
   - Verify you can access /profile/edit immediately after signup

2. **Existing User Profile View**:
   - Login with: pct1089547896lig@gmail.com
   - Click profile icon in navbar → "View Profile"
   - Should see profile page with user data (NOT "User not found")

3. **Profile Editing**:
   - From navbar → "Edit Profile"
   - Should see edit form (NOT "Access denied")
   - Update display name and bio
   - Click Save
   - Verify changes persist

4. **Profile Route Redirect**:
   - Navigate to: https://2w53uogwhovv.space.minimax.io/profile
   - Should auto-redirect to /profile/:userId for logged-in user
   - Should redirect to login if not authenticated

5. **Profile URL Access**:
   - Direct access to /profile/:userId should work for any valid user ID
   - Invalid user IDs should show "User not found" (expected behavior)

### Deployment Details

- **URL**: https://2w53uogwhovv.space.minimax.io
- **Build Status**: Success (1.01 MB optimized bundle)
