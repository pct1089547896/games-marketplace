## Required Actions to Complete Setup

### Action 1: Create Storage Bucket (2 minutes)

**Step-by-step instructions**:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dieqhiezcpexkivklxcw/storage/buckets

2. Click the "New bucket" or "Create bucket" button

3. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Name: gallery-images
   Public bucket: ON (toggle to enable)
   File size limit: 10485760
   Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif
   ```

4. Click "Create bucket" button

5. Verify you see "gallery-images" in the bucket list

### Action 2: Apply Storage RLS Policies (1 minute)

After creating the bucket:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dieqhiezcpexkivklxcw/sql

2. Click "New Query"

3. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Storage RLS Policies for gallery-images bucket
-- Drop existing policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access for gallery-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow upload via edge function" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update gallery images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete gallery images" ON storage.objects;

-- Policy 1: Public can read/view images
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for gallery-images" 
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT 
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-images');

-- Policy 2: Allow uploads (includes 'anon' role - CRITICAL!)
CREATE POLICY "Allow upload via edge function" 
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'gallery-images'
  AND (
    auth.role() = 'anon' 
    OR auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    OR auth.role() = 'service_role'
  )
);

-- Policy 3: Allow updates
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update gallery images" 
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'gallery-images'
  AND (
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    OR auth.role() = 'service_role'
  )
);

-- Policy 4: Allow deletes
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete gallery images" 
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'gallery-images'
  AND (
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    OR auth.role() = 'service_role'
  )
);
```

4. Click "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)

5. Verify you see "Success" message
