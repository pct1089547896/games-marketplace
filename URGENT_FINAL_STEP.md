# CRITICAL UPDATE - Storage Bucket Found!

## Test Results Just Completed

I just ran a storage verification test and discovered:

### ✅ GOOD NEWS: Storage Bucket EXISTS!
The `gallery-images` bucket was successfully created.

### ❌ MISSING: RLS Policies Not Applied
Upload test failed with: "new row violates row-level security policy"

**This means**: You created the bucket (Step 1 ✓) but haven't applied the RLS policies yet (Step 2 ✗)

---

## What You Need to Do NOW (90 seconds)

You're almost done! Just one more step:

### Apply RLS Policies

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dieqhiezcpexkivklxcw/sql

2. **Click**: "New Query"

3. **Copy and paste THIS EXACT SQL**:

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access for gallery-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow upload via edge function" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update gallery images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete gallery images" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Public read access for gallery-images" 
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow upload via edge function" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'gallery-images' AND (auth.role() = 'anon' OR auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR auth.role() = 'service_role'));

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update gallery images" 
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE 
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-images' AND (auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR auth.role() = 'service_role'));

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete gallery images" 
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE 
USING (bucket_id = 'gallery-images' AND (auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR auth.role() = 'service_role'));
```

4. **Click**: "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)

5. **Verify**: You should see "Success. No rows returned"

---

## After Running the SQL

**Immediately test**:
1. Go to: https://1klct3zdsvna.space.minimax.io
2. Log in to admin panel
3. Try uploading an image
4. Should work perfectly!

**Then tell me**: "Done" or "RLS policies applied"

And I will:
- Run final verification tests
- Test actual image upload
- Confirm system is production-ready
- Provide deployment report

---

## Why This Step Is Critical

The RLS policies tell Supabase:
- Who can upload files (anon + authenticated users)
- Who can view files (everyone - public access)
- Who can delete files (authenticated users only)

Without these policies, ALL uploads are blocked by Supabase security.
