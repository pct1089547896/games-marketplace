# Screenshot Gallery Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolution
**Original Problem:** Screenshot gallery in GameDetailPage.tsx was not interactive
- Users couldn't click thumbnails to change the main image
- No larger view functionality
- Missing visual indicators for selected images
- Gallery lacked professional navigation features

## Solution Implemented

### 1. State Management
Added two new state variables to track gallery state:
```typescript
const [selectedImageIndex, setSelectedImageIndex] = useState(0);
const [showLightbox, setShowLightbox] = useState(false);
```

### 2. Interactive Main Image
**Before:** Static 384px image with no interaction
**After:** 
- Increased to 500px height for better visibility
- Clickable to open full-screen lightbox
- Image counter badge (e.g., "3 / 8")
- Hover effect with subtle overlay
- Uses selectedImageIndex to display current image

### 3. Interactive Thumbnail Gallery  
**Before:** Static thumbnails, some not displayed, no click functionality
**After:**
- All screenshots displayed in 5-column responsive grid
- Click any thumbnail to change main image
- Selected thumbnail: Black ring border (ring-4) + scale effect + shadow
- Non-selected thumbnails: Hover effects (opacity, scale)
- Visual feedback on every interaction

### 4. Full-Screen Lightbox Modal
**New Feature:** Professional image viewer with:
- Full-screen display (90vh max height)
- Dark overlay background (95% opacity)
- Navigation arrows (left/right) with wraparound
- Close button (×) in top-right
- Click outside to close
- Thumbnail navigation strip at bottom
- Image counter display
- Event bubbling prevention (stopPropagation)

### 5. Keyboard Navigation
**New Feature:** Accessibility and power user support:
- Arrow Left/Right: Navigate between images
- ESC key: Close lightbox
- Event listener cleanup on unmount
- Only active when lightbox is open

### 6. Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly thumbnail grid
- Touch-friendly tap targets
- Responsive lightbox on all screen sizes
- Overflow handling for many images
